            <h1>Pokemon</h1>
            <p>electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in February 1996 
            as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red. The franchise later became wildly popular 
            in the United States and around the world. The series, originally produced 
            for the company’s Game Boy line of handheld consoles, was introduced in 1998 
            to the United States with two titles, known to fans as Red and Blue. In the 
            games, players assume the role of Pokémon trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters 
            and developing them to battle other Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most 
            successful video game franchises in the world. The thing that the players do in 
            the game is to capture, grow, and ballte pokemons.</p>

                <p>Pokémon is a role-playing adventure game series where you explore a vibrant 
                world filled with unique creatures called Pokémon. Each Pokémon has its own 
                personality, abilities, and type. As a player, you travel from town to town, catching Pokémon, 
                training them, and building a team strong enough to take on rival trainers and 
                powerful Gym Leaders.<br><br>

                Along the way, you meet all kinds of characters, uncover small stories hidden in each 
                region, and watch your Pokémon grow stronger through battles and friendship. The games 
                are designed to be relaxing and exciting at the same time—there’s no one “right” way to 
                play. Some people like collecting every Pokémon, some enjoy battling competitively, and 
                others simply want to explore the world at their own pace.</p>
