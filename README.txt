# CGT-141-Project

If you want to "run" the project locally, place all files (php, html, css) except images in the same folder, and have an "images" folder with all the images in the same spot. I have each file type in a separate folder, as the rubric says, but it was not intended to be run this way. Also, if you run it locally, some pages will not work because the website is database-driven. 

We believe we have met everything in the rubric besides three things:

1. At least one content page should utilize a link that sends the user somewhere in the same document. 

We could not find a place to have a link that takes the user to another spot on the same page that would be useful. 

2. The site must include at least one form, containing at least 5 form elements.

There are two database-driven forms, each with 3 elements. One to write a new article and another to edit an article. We could not increase the number of elements in the forms in a way that would make the two new elements useful. 

3. Must use background, image, table, and text css properties.

All of these CSS properties are used except table, as once again, there is no good place in my website to use it.
