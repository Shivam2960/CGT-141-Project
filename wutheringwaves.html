        <p>
          This article introduces the lore and backstory of two popular characters from Wuthering Waves: Iuno and Chisa.
        </p>

        <h2 class="h4">The Defier of Fate: Iuno</h2>
        <p><em>"Beyond myself. Beyond every written start and end of the story. Until we rewrite our fate." - Iuno</em></p>

        <p>
          Iuno, priestess of Septimont, is admired for her beauty and confident personality. She appears only during the most important celebrations, such as the Great Agon held every four years. Because she enforces strict rules during these events, many people assume she is cold and unapproachable. However, Rover learns through close interaction that Iuno is genuinely warm and caring.
        </p>

        <p>
          During Septimont’s battle against the Dark Tide, Iuno nearly sacrificed herself to create a protective barrier for the citizens. As a result of this act, everyone lost their memories of her. Only Rover was able to recover her fragmented existence before it disappeared entirely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although her heroism is forgotten by the world, Iuno is content knowing that Rover remembers who she truly is.

        <h2 class="h4">Startorch Academy Student: Kuchiba Chisa</h2>
        <p><em>"I will cut through this deadlock." - Chisa</em></p>

        <p>
          Chisa introduces herself as an ordinary student at Startorch Academy, but she also possesses the power to divide dimensions. With this ability, she rescues Honami City from a repeating timeline.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her power originated from a traumatic childhood incident. After defending a bullied student, Chisa became the target of intense harassment. Her belongings were destroyed, and she developed a disorder that prevented her from recognizing faces. To her, the emotional connections that once held people together felt broken.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, her trauma begins to heal after forming a deep trust with Rover. With renewed courage, she prepares to reenter society after years of isolation.
