        <p>
          The <strong>FIFA</strong> series, created by EA Sports, began in 1993 with
          <em>FIFA International Soccer</em>, one of the first football games to feature
          an official license from FIFA. This partnership helped the series stand out early,
          allowing it to include real national teams and, later, real clubs, players, and leagues.
          As technology advanced, FIFA embraced more realistic physics, player behavior, and
          broadcast-style presentation, making each annual release feel closer to real football.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022, EA and FIFA ended their long licensing agreement. This brought the “FIFA” branding
          to an end with <em>FIFA 23</em>, and starting in 2023 the series continued under a new title:
          <strong>EA Sports FC</strong>. The rebrand kept the core gameplay foundation while opening
          the door to new partnerships, licensing opportunities, and features.

          The FIFA series, now known as <strong>EA Sports FC</strong>, has remained one of the
          world’s most iconic football game franchises since its debut. Each yearly release
          introduced improved graphics, smoother gameplay, and an expanding roster of real teams,
          players, and leagues. With modes like Career, Ultimate Team, and Online Seasons,
          the series lets players build clubs, manage squads, and compete globally.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the rebrand to EA Sports FC, the series continued with the same core football
          experience while evolving its presentation and features. but the spirit of authentic football gaming, 
          such as realistic matches, strategic team-building, and high-stakes online competition, remains at
          the heart of the series.
