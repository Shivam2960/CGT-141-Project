            <h1>FC Series(FIFA)</h1>
            <p>The FIFA series, created by EA Sports, began in 1993 with FIFA International Soccer, 
            one of the first football games to feature an official license from FIFA. This partnership 
            helped the series stand out early, allowing it to include real national teams and later 
            real clubs, players, and leagues. 

            As technology advanced, FIFA embraced more realistic physics, player behavior, and broadcast-style 
            presentation, making each annual release feel closer to real football. 

            In 2022, EA and FIFA ended their long licensing agreement. This brought the “FIFA” branding to an end 
            with FIFA 23, and starting in 2023, the series continued under a new title: EA Sports FC. </p>

                <p>The FIFA series, created by EA Sports, has been one of the 
                    world’s most iconic football game franchises since its debut 
                    in 1993. Each yearly release introduced improved graphics, 
                    smoother gameplay, and a growing roster of real teams, players, 
                    and leagues. With modes like Career, Ultimate Team, and Online Seasons, 
                    the series let players build clubs, manage teams, and compete globally. 
                    In 2023, after ending its partnership with FIFA, EA rebranded the series 
                    as EA Sports FC, continuing the same gameplay foundation while expanding 
                    licensing and features. FC represents a new chapter, but the spirit of authentic 
                    football gaming remains unchanged.</p>
