          Once Human is a free-to-play, open-world survival action game
          developed and published by Starry Studio (under NetEase). It launched on PC
          on July 9, 2024. Players explore a strange, post-apocalyptic world filled with
          mutated creatures, eerie structures, and mysterious anomalies while gathering
          resources, building bases, and fighting to survive.

        <h2 class="h4 mb-2">Article’s Purpose</h2>
        <p class="mb-0">
          This article outlines the main pros and cons of Once Human as a game
          and helps you decide whether it is worth playing for your tastes.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fs-5 mb-4">
        <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Pros</h2>

        <h3 class="h5">Exploration, Atmosphere, and World Design:</h3>
        <p>
          The world is often praised as immersive and varied. You’ll find urban decay zones,
          creepy mutated areas, strange buildings, and other surreal locations that create
          a strong horror/sci-fi atmosphere. Simply wandering and discovering new spots can
          be one of the most enjoyable parts of the game.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Strong Mix of Genres:</h3>
        <p>
          Once Human blends survival, crafting, base building, open-world exploration,
          shooter combat, and light MMO/RPG systems. You gather resources, craft gear, build
          and upgrade a base, and fight enemies alongside or against other players. If you like
          games that combine many different systems into one package, this variety can be very appealing.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Combat and Enemy Design:</h3>
        <p>
          Many players highlight the enemy design, especially the mutated monsters and bosses, as
          a strong point. Tougher encounters can feel satisfying to overcome, thanks to creative
          creature designs and the feeling of tension in certain fights or zones.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="fs-5 mb-4">
        <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Cons</h2>

        <h3 class="h5">Technical Issues and Performance:</h3>
        <p>
          A recurring complaint is that performance can be inconsistent on many machines.
          Players report frame-rate drops, stutters, pop-in, and occasional graphical glitches,
          especially in dense or action-heavy situations. While patches may improve things over time,
          optimization is still a concern for some.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Repetitive, Grindy Progression:</h3>
        <p>
          Even though the world and systems feel engaging at first, some players find that
          the core loop: gathering resources, building, grinding for upgrades,
          becomes repetitive. Once the novelty of the setting and mechanics wears off, the game
          can start to feel like a grind if you’re not inherently drawn to long-term progression.
        </p>

        <h3 class="h5 mt-3">Weak Story and Mission Variety:</h3>
        <p>
          The narrative and mission design are sometimes viewed as thin or generic. Story delivery
          may feel straightforward or uninspired, and many quests boil down to familiar objectives.
          If strong storytelling is your main priority, <em>Once Human</em> might not fully satisfy you.
        </p>
