    <h1>How does this website work?</h1>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>This website is similar to other wikis, but is focused on games</li>
        <li>Anyone can write articles about their favorite game for anyone to see</li>
        <li>The developers of this website will read the articles</li>
        <li>At first, the article will be classified as an unofficial article until the developers review it </li>
        <li>If they like the article, it will be categorized as an "official article" and will be formatted to appear better, and the article will be revised</li>
        <li>Once the article has been converted to an “official article,” it cannot be revised further</li>
        <li>If they believe the article still needs work, it will remain as an unofficial article, leaving the article open for other users to edit further and revise it </li>
        <li>This system will motivate users to write high-quality articles and will ensure readers will know which articles are guaranteed to be high-quality</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Who are the creators of this website?</h1>
